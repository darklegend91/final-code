#How to run the code
Steps to Run the code
1) First step is data generation so we have to run data_gen.py for data genartion for desired parameters.
2) We have to tran the model so we have to reun train.py to train the model and generate weights for the same.
3) To test the modesl for our desired resuts we have to run iterations.py , nmse_vs_snr.py and resnorm_vs_snr.py

After running all these files we will be getting the excel sheets and graphs will be plotted for same data.
